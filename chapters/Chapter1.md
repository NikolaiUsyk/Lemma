## Chapter 1

* __Dmitri and Ivan Shevckenko__

Broad, gloomy Dmitri Shevchenko leaned forward in his chair in the second to last row of the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ in Kiev. He fiddled with his fingers and, in a practiced furtive way, scanned the room. The Patriarch raised the cup and wafer over his head, his back to the crowd he half-chanted, "Thine own of Thine own, we offer You, in behalf of all, and for all!"

There was geniune feeling in it, odd. Religion is like that, you go through the motions in monotone for years and then one day you realize what you've been saying all at once. He stopped pressing his folded hands and craned his neck at the dais. Goddamn it he hated this building. The glossy marble floor, polished to a mirror, took any rare scrap of Kiev light and lit the massive white dome and every square centimeter of the cornerless transept. You could barely smell the incense.

The congregation rose and responded, "We praise You, we bless You, we thank You, O Lord, and we pray to You, our God." A younger man sat behind him to the right. "I love this church, my favorite game is Patriarch or Mullah."

Dmitri leaned back, and showed himself in profile. His shoulders rose in a smirk,  "Convert or die Mykhailo. It's coming in nicely don't you think?"

"Like a bird's nest. Actually no, like a brillo pad. We could use a cutting for dishes back at barracks."

"The perks of freedom include devotion."

"So what are you, like, Italian?  Who's your Papist holy man?"

Dmitri turned further and shot him a playful glare, "Sviatoslav?  He's from Lviv.  Where I'll be going just as soon as you hand it over.  I can't wait to get the fuck out of Kiev."

"The hero of Donetsk can't stand a couple hours in his own beautiful capital. Sad."

"You miss me that much?"

Mikhailo looked away for a moment, "Yeah, kinda.  We get it though.  But the Russians and the Turks, and the goddamn EU."  He looked around, they hadn't attracted too much attention. "It's just," he paused and sighed and put a USB into Dmitri's suddenly open palm, "like even the allies don't really want us to win. The enemy is a constant phantom, we don't fight armies we fight rumors."

"The Western journalists were with us in Donetsk, after what they saw I had to resign." He fiddled with the USB stick. "Thanks, Mikhailo. I'm glad there's someone out there who doesn't think I'm a war criminal.  Go.  They're about to distribute communiion."

Mikhailo stood up with the rest of the crowd, nodded and walked off.  They chanted, "Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord: the Lord is God and has revealed Himself to us." Then row by row they filed into the main aisle and queued for the eucharist.  Dmitri waited for five minutes and left.

It was overcast and the Dneiper looked like sludge. He knew he shouldn't be so negative, this was his first mission as a private contractor. He could remain in the fight, grow his beard, and see his family. It was a win for everyone, he knew that but it was hard to feel it.

He took out his (Smartphone +), it's tip was flashing blue and yellow. He snapped open the baton and privately heard, "125 new messages from Ivan. Message one: ".  He closed it immediately and walked quickly toward the nearest buisiness. Goddamn church in the middle of goddamn nowhere.

Just writing "chapter 1" puts a huge chill on the writing effort
