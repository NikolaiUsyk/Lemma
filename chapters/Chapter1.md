## Chapter 1

Slow pedal, wind and leaf in autumn.  
Tibia, fibula, femur, quad and calf.
How one pulls while the other pushes - how can sinew push?

The cab stops awkwardly near the corner, she quick checks and dodges and makes a rounder arc to turn on Spruce.

A reason for everything

*******

Just writing "chapter 1" puts a huge chill on the writing effort
