### Julie Li

Julie Li decided to ride her bike to campus.  It was a nice day for late October, the road was dry and she had half-purposefully missed the bus to the subway to the el or trolley and over the river. She turned West on Fairmount, unhurriedly, midterms over, no tests for another four weeks. MCATs coming up though, next month. Shit no, two weeks. Red light. Pull break levers. Wobble slighly. Put right foot down. Lean on rams-head handlebars and take a deep breath. Why the moment she felt happy about anything did she need to find a thought to pull it back?

Green. No, not crisp. Crisp is cooler; this is body temperature, feels perfect. Climate change. There it goes again. No, not body temperature, that's like 98. Equilibrium? Yeah, that's right. The natural epidermal temperature such that the heat produced by the metabolic process is dissipated to the ambient environment at the same rate as it's produced.  Medical biochemistry, CH 353, last spring. Some of it was sinking in. Dr. Molinari would be proud. No, satisfied. Ryan was in that class, in her lab group. Not in any this semester though, too bad. He was easy to work with. Why? It felt like he didn't assume too much about her except competence. Men, well boys, it seemed like sometimes didn't think she was as smart, maybe. Ryan didn't exude that. And he was tall. Is it a crush? No not a crush. If she had a crush she would just ask him out. Definitely, if that's what it was she would go for it.
