### Glenda Miller

When the internet went out she lost it.  She had only moved in with Brad five months ago, but within the first few minutes after the outage she knew she would be looking for a new place by the end of the day.  She was about to push the most intricate worm to the server when pop.  Days of poking the bear softly, remotely, probingly, a good job's yearly salary hers as soon as she could deploy it.

Suddenly, but expectedly, her memory cut out. Like a seg fault[^seg][^run][^lang] you know is there but can't find. When she came around, every plate and cup and lamp and electronic was smashed apart from her laptop. She sighed and, feeling something approaching genuine melancholy, walked to the bedroom where she roughly pulled every scrap of her clothing from the hangers and drawers. Then she rifled through Brad's drawers and nightstand taking anything of possible value, some chargers, a watch, a tie that she knew was a gift from his son. She tended to the cuts on her feet and hands which were fortunately minor, brought her bags into the living room, collected her laptop, the router and the modem and left. Too bad nobody keeps cash anymore, she thought as she threw her hasty bags into the backseat of the black SUV in the driveway. Before it had finished saying hello, she silenced Ozzy, the car's autonomous system, slotting a USB stick into a microcontroller waiting in the glove box jacked in to the main system. She pulled a fat key with a thin jagged edge like a rune from her jacket pocket. She paused before she turned the key, chin hovering over her hand on top of the steering wheel, keys in the legacy slot. She hadn't seen a moment's outage in five years. This was something big, maybe a solar flare; she didn't really have a plan for that. "In any case," she said to herself as she turned the key in the ignition and turned her torso to back-out, "I need more information." She looked back at the house, door swinging open in the arid exurban breeze, "They might even think it's a real break-in," she smiled satisfied as she sped off to town.

Albany: a metropolis in its surroundings, globally a speck. She coasted up a deserted York Street halfway to the water and parked illegally covert alley. She expected there to be more of a to-do considering the lack of communications. A vision of a possible apocalpyse flashed in her head like that tv series from the States, vague notions of all the good people being raptured and society crumbling. Of course, she wouldn't be ascended she acknowledged without a hint of guilt. She would likely be in god's bottom 5% with Charles Manson and Rolf Harris[^Harris]. She wrapped her head with a pastel shawl and oversize sunglasses, a Hollywood burqa. Why had she come here, specifically? It was almost automatic. She remembered that she remembered a bar from a long time ago within a couple blocks, longshoremen drank there when they existed. Who was it at that time? Ethan maybe, one of the first. It's as good a place as any to find out what's happening.

She stepped in and looked around unhesitatingly before taking a seat at the bar. Classic rock played at a murmur from an old mechanical jukebox. The bartender was her age; he was slowly restocking the shelves noting levels on a small pad. A group of mostly younger guys in jeans and Oxford shirts were drinking a pitcher at a high table in the corner. She took off her glasses and ordered a whisky and coke to the bartender's back. He turned, and her stomach dropped in a way it rarely did; he was an acquaintance from high school, Reggie the fat kid.  What the hell is with today?

He paused momentarily, "Sure thing." Filling the glass with ice, he asked "Well alright?"

"Yeah."

He made it strong, and passed it to her on a dusty napkin. She took a sip. Time was of the essence; she decided to be direct. "So what the hell is going on?" She asked, her arms crossed on the bar like a disappointed principal.

He didn't really hear her, he was looking at her thoughtfully. "I swear, you look just like this girl, woman, Meghan Harper. I went to school with her in Alice Springs. But you look like you take care of yourself, she certainly didn't."

"Hmm. Odd. It's an odd day." She stared at him deadpan.

He looked away.  "Sure is." He seemed to snap out of it. "Yeah, those guys over there are engineers at the dock. They said all the servers is West Oz are down. Whatever the hell that means. I guess it means most of the other places in town are closed cause their systems and such are down. They were pretty excited when they came in."

She feigned disinterest. She feigned things well. "So all of them?  Just in West Oz?  That's what they said?"

"Yeah apparently everyone else is fine. Kept saying ALL, you know. Like, wow ALL of them. I don't know what that means. They said they know because they've got a special connection at the port."

She downed her drink, left a ten on the table and turned in her chair almost before he stopped talking.

"Hey, what? It's only 6." He called.

 She didn't answer. On the way back to the car she searched her options. Farmers have satellite, but it's slow and hard to positively anonymize. Too risky. She needed to be on the move; the car was technically stolen now, not that he could report it.  Brad was probably home early freaking out. She set out for the border into the big nothing[^dist].

[^seg]:
    A seg fault - short for segmentation fault is a fatal runtime error^2^ in a computer program, usually caused by requesting access to a memory location not available to the program.

[^run]:
    Portions of programs written in compiled languages^3^ are executed at two different times, compile time and runtime. Compile time is when the compiler translates the source code into binary, this is when errors are most obvious.  Runtime is when the computer executes the binary instructions.

[^lang]:
    Computer languages fall into two general categories based on their mechanism of operation: compiled and interpreted. Compiled languages are translated into binary and then run, interpreted languages can be run by being passed through an interpreter.

[^Harris]:
    Australian Bob Ross-type television painter and paedophilic sex criminal.

[^dist]:
    Western Australia is the second largest country subdivision by area.  It would be the tenth largest country in the world.  It's roughly 1,000 miles to the border with South Australia.
