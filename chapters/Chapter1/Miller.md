### Glenda Miller

When the internet went out, she lost it.  She had only moved in with Brad five months ago, but within the first few minutes after the outage she knew she would be looking for a new place by the end of the day.  She was about to push the most intricate worm to the server when pop.  Days of poking the bear softly, remotely, probingly, a good job's yearly salary hers as soon as she could deploy it.

Suddenly, but expectedly, her memory cut out. When she came around, every plate and cup and lamp and electronic was smashed apart from her laptop. She sighed and, feeling something approaching genuine melancholy, walked to the bedroom where she roughly pulled every scrap of her clothing from the hangers and drawers. Then she rifled through Brad's drawers and nightstand taking anything of possible value, some chargers, a watch, a tie that she knew was a gift from his son. She tended to the cuts on her feet and hands which were fortunately minor, brought her bags into the living room, collected her laptop, the router and the modem and left. Too bad nobody keeps cash anymore, she thought as she threw her hasty bags into the backseat of the black SUV in the driveway. She paused before she turned the key, chin hovering over her hand on top of the steering wheel, keys in the slot; she hadn't seen a moment's outage in five years. This was something big, maybe a solar flare; she didn't really have a plan for that. "In any case," she said to herself as she turned the key in the ignition and turned her torso to back-out, "I need more information." She looked back at the house, door swinging open in the arid exurban breeze, "They might even think it's a real break-in," she smiled satisfied as she sped off to town.
