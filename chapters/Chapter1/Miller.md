### Glenda Miller

- Scammer? Kinda, hacker-ish, black-hat,
abuse in her past. 50 years old, looks like a yoga teacher (kinda), but not clean living.

When the internet went out, she kinda lost it.  She had only moved in with Brad five months ago, but within the first few minutes 
she knew she would be looking for a new place by the end of the day.  She was about to push the most intricate assembly to the server when pop.  
Online editor went tits up and it was lost.  Days of discrete math, a years salary.
