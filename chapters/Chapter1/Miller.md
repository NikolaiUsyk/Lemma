### Glenda Miller

When the internet went out she lost it.  She had only moved in with Brad five months ago, but within the first few minutes after the outage she knew she would be looking for a new place by the end of the day.  She was about to push the most intricate worm to the server when pop.  Days of poking the bear softly, remotely, probingly, a good job's yearly salary hers as soon as she could deploy it.

Suddenly, but expectedly, her memory cut out. Like a seg fault[^seg][^run][^lang] you know is there but can't find. When she came around, every plate and cup and lamp and electronic was smashed apart from her laptop. She sighed and, feeling something approaching genuine melancholy, walked to the bedroom where she roughly pulled every scrap of her clothing from the hangers and drawers. Then she rifled through Brad's drawers and nightstand taking anything of possible value, some chargers, a watch, a tie that she knew was a gift from his son. She tended to the cuts on her feet and hands which were fortunately minor, brought her bags into the living room, collected her laptop, the router and the modem and left. Too bad nobody keeps cash anymore, she thought as she threw her hasty bags into the backseat of the black SUV in the driveway. Before it had finished saying hello, she silenced Ozzy, the car's autonomous system, slotting a USB stick into a microcontroller waiting in the glove box jacked in to the main system. She pulled a fat key with a thin jagged edge like a rune from her jacket pocket. She paused before she turned the key, chin hovering over her hand on top of the steering wheel, keys in the legacy slot. She hadn't seen a moment's outage in five years. This was something big, maybe a solar flare; she didn't really have a plan for that. "In any case," she said to herself as she turned the key in the ignition and turned her torso to back-out, "I need more information." She looked back at the house, door swinging open in the arid exurban breeze, "They might even think it's a real break-in," she smiled satisfied as she sped off to town.

Albany: a metropolis in its surroundings, globally a speck. She coasted up a deserted York Street halfway to the water and parked illegally covert alley. She expected there to be more of a to-do considering the lack of communications. A vision of a possible apocalpyse flashed in her head like that tv series from the States, vague notions of all the good people being raptured and society crumbling. Of course, she wouldn't be ascended she acknowledged without a hint of guilt. She would likely be in god's bottom 5% with Charles Manson and Rolf Harris[^Harris]. She wrapped her head with a pastel shawl and oversize sunglasses, a Hollywood burqa. Why had she come here, specifically? It was almost automatic. She remembered that she remembered a bar from a long time ago within a couple blocks, longshoremen drank there when they existed. Who was it at that time? Ethan maybe, one of the first. It's as good a place as any to find out what's happening.

Takes car to bar to see WTF is happening.  Talks to bartender, he almost recognizes her from decades ago.  "I swear, you look just like Meghan Harper.  I went to school with her.  But you look like you take care of yourself, she certainly didn't.  Must look about 100 right now."  She's kind of wearing sunglasses and a shawl like an incognito movie star.  It's a dive, like the kind that would have been really rowdy in 1975 when longshoremen were a thing.  Now it's a divey gastropub for the dock engineers.  Who I guess must all be there (Actually takes cash, that's why it's open.  Says "Back in 2022, when everything went cashless the owner decided to keep it.  Just in case you know.").  Only the young ones are there.  She considers a sad older mentor giving her half an eye as a potential mark, but chastises herself for it.  Finds out all the servers are down.  Satellite isn't an option, no way to encrypt, and so slow.  They'll find her before it's even up.  Not that it would really matter, but who wants the hassle and 1 week to month in a local bumblefuck lockup.  She takes off for Adelaide.

[^seg]: 
    A seg fault - short for segmentation fault is a fatal runtime error^2^ in a computer program, usually caused by requesting access to a memory location not available to the program.

[^run]: 
    Portions of programs written in compiled languages^3^ are executed at two different times, compile time and runtime. Compile time is when the compiler translates the source code into binary, this is when errors are most obvious.  Runtime is when the computer executes the binary instructions. 

[^lang]: 
    Computer languages fall into two general categories based on their mechanism of operation: compiled and interpreted. Compiled langauges are translated into binary and then run, interpreted languages can be run by being passed through an interpreter.

    Australian Bob Ross-type television painter and paedophilic sex criminal.
