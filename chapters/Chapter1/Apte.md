### Vikram Apte

Vikram was late, which was uncharacteristic. The several alarms he set throughout his apartment each night remained silent as the sun crept through the crack in his curtain. As the light struck him, his eyes fluttered, and his expression transitioned from groggy to confused to angry to worried. He rolled off his mattress in half-clean boxers and saw the cause of the malfunction as the dresser clock blinked 4:55.

Still, the backups should have worked. This is why he had systems. What kind of network manager was he if he couldn't automate a simple, fail-safe morning routine. What time was it anyway?

"Gary, what time is it?" he bellowed as he rubbed his eyes and shook off the fog from last night's beer. 

There was no response.

"Gary, Gary...", he called to no avail as he walked around his two bedroom, one bath apartment with quite a large closet.

"What the fuck." He turned over his pillows and bedsheets, looked behind the junk on his furniture, checked his dresser drawers with undirected hostility and finally found his stick by the side of the couch in the living room. The battery was dead. He remembered charging it two weeks ago, normally it lasted a month or so. He regretted tossing the mechanical alarm clock; it couldn't be automated.

He threw open the curtains, plugged the stick in, and hopped in the shower while nuking some leftover daal his mother had given him last weekend. Wolfing it down in a towel at the table, absent-mindedly he scanned his small dark living room. Fucking Mumbai, four times the national average salary and he lived in a dump. If only he had a wife; he should have let his mother arrange a match when it still worked like that. He hated the idea back then and welcomed the reforms, the institution seemed so primitive. He wasn't so sure about anything anymore.

He turned on the half-charged stick, it lit up immediately and his face dropped. It was 7:15. The morning crush was already well underway. It would take at least an hour maybe more to get in, and he was due at 7:00. Maybe he should call in sick. Risky, but Sunil would be pissed regardless. Who cares, maybe if he lost his job things would get better; if the executives were any indication, being groomed for management might be a curse.

He slid open the stick and the hologram rose and there was no service. He froze. When was the last time he saw that? That trip to the Ghats five, no, six years ago. He'd better get out there and find a phone before or they'll fire him before he even gets through. What the hell is going on?

He pulled his clothes out blind and ran out the door. Wait, he can't call from anywhere else they'll see the number isn't his. He turned around and grabbed his bag; he'll have to go. 

He sprinted down the street to the commuter train, threw elbows in the crush, and waited miserable and crammed standing up holding his bag against his stomach in the hot solid mass of flesh.  He and his neighbors sweat through his shirt. They'd write him up for that too, perhaps.

Maybe he'll be alright and nothing will change; the whole city must be in a similar situation situation. He's well liked, one of the most compenent. He pulled out the stick as he sprinted to the next train in Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus<!--[^mumbaiTrain](Footnote?)-->. No service and no wifi. Something is definitely going on. It'll probably be him and Avarind patching it up. It's strange that no one seems to be panicking. He slid onto the express train much more easily than usual; that's how late he is the crush is already ebbing.

Suddenly, he remembered last night. It must have drained the power stuck in a loop looking for a connection, which was down because of the power, to push the code he was bragging about yesterday. He should really keep his mouth shut about that. After a few beers he wanted to show everyone how great he is. Weird though that the exploit he found would get him in trouble like this. He expected the cybercrimes division not a power outage plus bad timing.

Deep in his reverie they stopped at a station, and he noticed a woman in a power suit with a briefcase on the platform in a call on her stick. He checked his stick, no change. They moved on and he became very anxious.

He had no new ideas about the world as he stared wide and blank straight ahead for the next fifteen minutes as the train passed through the high glossy financial district, neighborhoods, and inner suburbs.  He got off at his stop and jogged open mouthed and sweaty the three blocks to the office as the heat of the day clocked in. All of this was impossible, no one else was affected.

When he arrived at the second floor stairway door covered in sweat it latched audibly. Everyone was out of their cubicles, arguing, drawing rapidly on whiteboards, describing plans emphatically to whoever could listen. They stopped and turned to look at him. "Oh thank God", he thought, "I'm not insane.  There really is a crisis."

Avarind came running up to him. "Vikram! Where the fuck have you been." he whispered as he led him away toward his cubicle.

"It's all out isn't it? My alarms...", he half smiled at the pleasure of explaining to someone other than himself.

"Yeah, in fucking Australia!" Avarind shouted inadvertently. He covered his mouth and peeked over the wall of Vikram's cubicle. He lowered his voice for Vikram, deflated and bewildered. "God you really do look terrible." He checked the hallway again, "I'll go grab you some water." He came back calmer with a water bottle and a paper towel. "Dude, Sunil is furious.  I mean furious and directly out here. It's the worst crisis I've ever seen and you're two hours late. He looked like a fucking tomato. You might already be fired. Look it's Australia. What the hell was in that code you sent me?"

Every other piece of the explanation Vikram had devised for the day had been wrong, why not this one too. He dripped some of the water on the towel and laid it on his forehead; he gave a faint laugh, "Why, did you get it?"

"The fuck are you laughing at? No, I didn't get it. You promised to send it so I can't be sure. I've only had a couple hours, but..." and he checked the hallway again, "whatever did this, it looks kinda like what you described. And it's kind of in your style, fuck a bunch of it is even in Haskell."

"No?" Vikram shot up shocked as Sunil appeared in the doorway.

"Vikram, follow me, now." And he was gone. Vikram shot up, grabbed the water bottle and practically kicked Avarind's knees out of his way. He jogged to catch up with Sunil just as he was entering his office. "Sit!"

Vikram almost started into his narrative even though he knew it would only make things worse, but as soon as Sunil sat down, he pulled out an envelope and tossed it across his desk. His moustache and glasses were almost quivering with anger. 

"Every single server in Western Australia is out. Mom and pop stores, father and son projects, kiddie porn creeper in his basement.  It's all gone.  Not the same architecture, some aren't even connected to the internet. The computers are fine, it's not an EMF. It's only Western Australia, and it stops precisely at the province border. As you know, we provide IT for the port of Perth..."

"The hospital! The..."

"Shut up!" He roared and slammed his fist on the envelope. "Shut up. People are going to die, this is a natural disaster. And you show up at 9 am. This is your flight to Adelaide. It leaves in 1 hour 45 minutes. You miss it, you're fired. Rent a car and drive to Perth. Go."

HIS CODE IS IN WHAT BREAKS THE SERVERS!  Lemma took it and used it to do that and shut off his phone in the meantime!
