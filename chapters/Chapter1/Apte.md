### Vikram Apte

Vikram was late, which was uncharacteristic. The several alarms he set throughout his apartment each night remained silent as the sun crept through the crack in his curtain. As the light struck him, his eyes fluttered, and his expression transitioned from groggy to confused to angry to worried. He rolled off his mattress in half-clean boxers and saw the cause of the malfunction as the dresser clock blinked 4:55.

Still, the backups should have worked. This is why he had systems. What kind of network manager was he if he couldn't automate a simple, fail-safe morning routine. What time was it anyway?

"Gary, what time is it?" he bellowed as he rubbed his eyes and shook off the fog from last night's beer. 

There was no response.

"Gary, Gary...", he called to no avail as he walked around his two bedroom, one bath apartment with quite a large closet.

What the fuck. He turned over his pillows and bedsheets, looked behind the junk on his furniture, checked his dresser drawers with undirected hostility and finally found his stick by the side of the couch in the living room. The battery was dead. He remembered charging it two weeks ago, normally it lasted a month or so. He regretted tossing the mechanical alarm clock, it couldn't be automated.

He plugged it in, hopped in the shower, threw on some clothes.

How did it go dead - searching for wifi unsuccessfully and no data connection and he had tried to upload something last night (code he braggadocioed about at the bar, like I'll hack your shit best dude with Avarind like playing horse with code) but without connection it just kept trying and trying to connect to wifi or data.

Boss name is Sunil.

They're sending him to Australia immediately.
