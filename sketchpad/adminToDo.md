## Site
-   Python Static Site Generator? Pelican Looks promising.
-   Maybe do the Ruby tutorial

## Immediate Work Tasks
-   Rewrite make with python.  Can I make python a stand-alone application? 
-   If I'm making a package for my project at what point should I make it a standalone package. (use stat to get last updated date)
-   It could really be a single class.
-   Call it makr:  A way to __*SIMPLY*__ automate builds. Also runnr?

## Questions for Tejas
-   Are the prices about right (4x national salary and you'd get a 1br)?
-   If he wanted to get married could he __just__ make that happen? Like if he really wants a wife wouldn't he be able to just announce it and women would joyously accept because 4x national average.
-   Where would someone like him live?  Geographically, how would he get to the North side where the IT firms are?

Well, I’m really hoping this hail storm is almost over, and despite my nerves, I’d like to come out of my little fall out shelter now, and say I can't tell you how much your support has meant. The past few days has been like a weird Facebook birthday and definitely involved growing up in a whole different way. If you can believe it, my intention wasn't to hurt Louis or vilify him, but this is a part of my experience and experience with him and the story needed to be told.
I’m far from any type of activist, and I had no deeper interest in this story other than to share the truth. I knew of Dana and Julia’s experience (not the details) within 2 minutes of getting off the phone with Louis, and I’m sure the conversation would have gone a bit differently if I was warned beforehand. Due to the times, we’re learning this shit is so pervasive and oftentimes so compulsive and chronic that it’s important to take a look at. I’m not sure if Louis did this to others who have yet to speak up, but I’d still be curious to know. And I think it’s important to know. But like all of this, we don’t know until people come forward.
Louis put out a statement, which frankly, made me cry. It touched me. And I do feel some of his insights speak to how I felt. I looked up to the people who recognized my work and made them (sigh), father figures/mentors whether they wanted that role or not. I shot myself in the foot, protected myself when I needed to be bold, was ‘bold’ when I should’ve been ‘poised’, hid behind ex-boyfriends, excuses, and the excuse of my excuses. I felt like I disappointed anyone who ever believed in me. But most of all, I never truly valued myself.
I don’t know how to upload Judd Apatow’s tweet, but I noticed something when reading it. The section from which he pulled was missing several words that apparently an editor from the nyt took out. I said Louis was ‘one of many’ reasons why I didn’t pursue ‘comedy’. He wasn’t the only one. He was one jenga piece. And as much as a part of me mourns not achieving that dream, I’m well aware certain personality types might have a better chance thriving in that world. I would say ‘the world’, but let’s not get too overdramatic.
(However, yesterday, someone handed me five dollars at my coffee shop thinking I was homeless, so… that’s uh, where I’m at. Plus if you can age a decade in three days, well, there ya have it).
I appreciate your feeling for me (for us… but I can’t speak for the others, as I think, like grieving a death, everyone handles it differently), and I’m sure you can only imagine the nick that a phone call like that might take on your already fragile self. But I didn’t stop creating. 
I just found different ways to express myself. And believe me. I understand, that a weird phone call is a hell of a lot different than what others experience, and I also realize, I’m the type of person that would have gone to Harvey’s hotel room.
In improv, we learn early, that there are no mistakes. Only discoveries. They become part of the whole.
There’s a whole big change happening. One day, I hope these mistakes will just be blips in the beautiful tapestry and not large burned out holes like we’re seeing today.
We see the sickness. Let’s address it. Get it healthy.
I got off easy with Louis. Others aren’t so lucky. But yes, he did abuse his power. And yes, obviously he has a ‘glitch’. But I do, too. We all do. We’re learning a new language here, and we need to be kind, and we need to be open, and we need to be fair, and we need to listen.
Really listen.
I do forgive Louis. I forgave him. But most of all, I think it’s time to forgive myself, too.
